# Backend Application

This folder contains the backend code for the project. It is structured to follow a clean architecture, separating concerns into different directories.

## Directory Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the backend application.
  - **controllers/**: Contains the controllers that handle incoming requests and responses.
  - **models/**: Contains the data models used in the application.
  - **routes/**: Contains the route definitions that link to the appropriate controllers.
  - **services/**: Contains the business logic and services for managing data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the backend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the backend directory to install the required packages.
2. **Compile TypeScript**: Use `tsc` to compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript.
3. **Run the Application**: Start the server using `node dist/index.js` (assuming the compiled files are in the `dist` directory).

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints defined in the routes. Refer to the documentation in the respective controller files for details on available endpoints and their usage.
